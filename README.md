### Introduction

NGI-NeutronStar is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline used for de-novo assembly and quality-control of 10x Genomics Chromium data. It's developed and used at the [National Genomics Infastructure](https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/) at [SciLifeLab Stockholm](https://www.scilifelab.se/platforms/ngi/), Sweden.

The pipeline uses [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a bioinformatics workflow tool. It pre-processes raw data from FastQ inputs, aligns the reads and performs extensive quality-control on the results.
